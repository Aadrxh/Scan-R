## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run Locally

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/EccentricExplorer/Scan-R.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd Scan-R
    ```

3.  **Open with a Live Server:**
    Scan-R requires a live server environment to function correctly, especially for the camera scanning and certain sharing features (due to browser security policies).

      * **VS Code Extension:** If you use VS Code, you can install the "Live Server" extension by Ritwick Dey. Right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server".
      * **Other options:** You can also use `http-server` (Node.js package) or any other local server software.

    ```bash
    # If you have Node.js installed, you can install http-server globally:
    npm install -g http-server
    # Then navigate to your project directory and run:
    http-server
    ```

    Your default browser will open the application, usually at `http://127.0.0.1:5500` or `http://localhost:8080`.
